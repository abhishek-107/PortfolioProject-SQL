# International Debt Analysis with SQL

This project analyzes international debt data collected by The World Bank, using SQL queries. 
The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The project seeks to answer questions like:

a) What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?

b) Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?

c) What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

 # Getting Started

Prerequisites:

To run the queries in this project, you will need:

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
A sample database "international_debt" (provided by DataCamp)

Installing:

Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.

Running the queries:

Open SSMS and connect to the database server.

Open the SQL script file "international_debt_analysis.sql".

Execute each SQL query one by one to obtain the results.

Data Source:

The source of the dataset is DataCamp, an online learning platform for data science.

# Project Description

This project consists of SQL queries that answer the following questions:

a) What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?

b) Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?

c) What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze international debt data. The queries used in this project can be used as a starting point for more complex analyses.
